# Clustering
# 1. DBSCAN
# Using DBSCAN iterate (for-loop) through different values of min_samples (1 to 10) and epsilon (.05 to .5, in steps of .01) to find clusters in the road-data used in the Lesson and calculate the Silohouette Coeff for min_samples and epsilon. Plot one line plot with the multiple lines generated from the min_samples and epsilon values. Use a 2D array to store the SilCoeff values, one dimension represents min_samples, the other represents epsilon. Expecting a plot of epsilon vs sil_score.


# 2. Clustering your own data
# Using your own data, find relevant clusters/groups within your data (repeat the above). If your data is labeled with a class that you are attempting to predict, be sure to not use it in training and clustering.
